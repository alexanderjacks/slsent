  On April 12th, 2019, the Department of Defense will begin to implement
  Directive-Type Memorandum 19-004, **a ban on transgender individuals serving
  openly in the military**. This directive is inhumane, discriminatory, and
  harms individuals who are willing and able to serve in the U.S. Armed Forces.

  To be clear: this is more than a military issue, this is more than an LGBTQ+
  issue, this is more than a transgender issue, this is an issue of human
  rights.
